| **Ternary Operator** | Single-line conditional expressions and chaining for shorthand `if/else` logic. |
| **Callbacks** | Fundamentals of function composition and essential patterns for handling asynchronous operations. |
| **Rest & Spread Operators** | Using the `...` syntax for flexible manipulation of arrays and objects (copying, merging, and argument collection). |
| **Array Transformations** | Essential methods for immutability and data manipulation: `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `find`, `every`, `some`. |
| **Loops and Iteration** | Differences and practical use of `forEach`, `for-of`, and `for-in` for traversing collections. |
| **Promises & Async/Await** | Handling modern asynchronous JavaScript, promise chaining, and error management. |
